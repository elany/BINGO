Alright so essentially this isn't <i>easier</i> than using an online generator in most cases, but what I wanted is a shareable generator where everything was already set up for the end user aka event participants in this case, and all variables are added by the mod(s). 
Everybody else just needs to click a button and they're ready to go =D
